# Library backend

## Week 7
### Objective
* Introduce Security concepts
* Explain USER and ROLE concept
* Explain authorization and Authentication
* Explain Security Context
* Explain Implementation

### Recommended approach:

* use included docker-compose to spin up database

### Notes
* Users and Roles are created manually
* Use https://bcrypt-generator.com/ with round = 1 to hash password to hash passwords

### Explanation
The purpose of the Security DB Demo Example is to demonstrate simple secure way of using **username / password** in a Rest Based Application.

HTTP web based applications are required to send authentication data each time the request is made. This means, such an application is required to store authentication data in browser, so they can be used for subsequent requests.
The web browser is prone to vulnerabilities which allows attackers to retrieve sensitive information. Storing sensitive data, such as **username / password**, is for this reason considered a security hole.

The simplest way of overcoming the issue is to exchange **username / password** combination for unique meaningless token. This way, only meaningless token is stored in a web application.
Important property of the token is its expiration time. The expiration time is stored in a backend database and must be validated each time the request is made. After token expiration, using such a token must result in request authentication failure.

Token expiration can be extended each time the application makes request. This means that token will be invalidated only after some time of inactivity.
The developer must be aware that this introduces security issue since attacker can potentially make periodic request to application to keep token from expiration.
The decision about the approach must be decided based on the application security requirements.

Token based approach allows backend application to log out the user by simple deleting token from token table.

### Basic Flows
#### Token Generation. 
* Post username / password to token generation url.
* Method: POST
* URL: /api/token
* Token is returned in a response "Authorization" header.

#### Send authorized request to business endpoints
* Copy authorization token from token generation response
* Add Authorization header to a request. (Including Bearer keyword.)

### Prerequisites
* None

### Homework
* Install docker and docker-compose on a local machine

## Week 2

### Objective
* Basic Maven explanation.
  * Maven repository concept. Local and remote.

  * mvn clean install
  * mvn spring-boot:run
  * Maven relation to IntelliJ IDE
* Explain application layering.

  * Explain Autowiring.
* Introduce and explain Swagger.

### Prerequisites
* Working WEEK1 homework code

### Homework
####  Using Customer service as an example, implement business logic (service) for following functionalities:
**Category**

```java 
package sk.umb.example.library.category.service;

public class CategoryService {
}
```

**Book**

```java 
package sk.umb.example.library.book.service;

public class BookService {
}
```

**Borrowing**

```java 
package sk.umb.example.library.borrowing.service;

public class BorrowingService {
}
```

#### For each functionality implement:
* Service backing methods for each of the Controller's API method.
* *DetailDto - placed in a service package.
* *RequestDto - placed in a service package.
* DTO properties: (If not mentioned, the request class does not contain an 'id' attribute)
  * Book Status (Java Enum)
    * AVAILABLE
    * NOT_AVAILABLE
    * TEMPORARY_NOT_AVAILABLE
  * Book detail
    * id 
    * author
    * title
    * isbn
    * count (number of a given title in library)
    * categoryIds (One book can be listed in multiple categories)
    * status (Book Status Enum)
  * Category detail
    * id
    * name
  * Borrowing detail
    * id
    * BookDetailDto
    * CustomerDetailDto
    * date (represent date of borrowing)
  * Borrowing request
    * bookId
    * customerId

#### Other
* Enable swaggers

#### Homework acceptance criteria
* For each service exists corresponding feature branch.
* Each feature branch is merged into main branch. (Use pull request for merging. Not mandatory however.).
* Application compiles and starts properly.
* Swagger is accessible.
* All services are implemented and functional using REST Api calls.

**Branching hint** 

Since borrowing detail partially depends on the implementation of Category, Book and Customer there are two options for dedicated borrowing feature branch.
  * Wait until the implementation of all dependencies are present in main branch, then fork the borrowing feature branch from the main.
  * Fork borrowing feature branch at the begining of the implementation, implement borrowing request (requestDto is independent of Customer and Book implementations), wait until the Customer and Book implementation are merged into the main branch, then backmerge the main branch into the borrowing feature branch.
